- Parallel testing caused bad test output when a test was skipped because a
  module could not be found on CPAN.

- The output from running a distro's Makefile.PL/Build.PL could stomp on the
  TAP output when running tests in parallel. We now simply close STDOUT when
  running this step, which is less than ideal, but fixes the breakage.

- This module can now run tests in parallel if you have Parallel::ForkManager
  installed. See the docs for details.

- The test_module() sub has been deprecated in favor a new sub,
  test_modules(). If you use test_module(), you can't ever run tests in
  parallel.

- We now defer loading CPAN.pm and related modules until tests are
  running. This avoids the possibility of CPAN prompting for config if
  Test::DependentModules is loaded but not actually used.

- Include author id in status line.


0.06   2010-07-14

- Ignore cargo-culted diag() output that's present in many modules, looking
  like this:

    # Testing Foo::Bar 0.01, Perl 5.00801, /usr/bin/perl

  This was being treated as a warning, but it can safely be ignored.

- Renamed the test_all_my_deps function to test_all_dependents.


0.04   2009-12-12

- Renamed to Test::DependentModules, since as Jesse Luehrs pointed out, we're
  not testing our dependencies, we're testing things that depend on us.

- All environment variables names starting with PERL_TEST_MD now start with
  PERL_TEST_DM.

- In some weird inexplicable case, testing a module seemed to somehow trigger
  File::Temp's cleanup routine too early, deleting the temp dir containing
  temporary prereq installations. Test::MyDeps now manages its temp dir
  manually.

- Changed how logging works. There are now three log files created, and you
  specify a log _directory_, not a file, via the


0.03   2009-12-12

- Added missing prereq on IO::Handle::Util


0.02   2009-12-12

- Fixed test_all_my_deps so the exclude parameter actually works.

- The PERL5LIB var did not include the temp dir containing temporarily
  installed second+ level depenencies.

- Renamed the TEST_PERL_MD_CPAN_VERBOSE env var to PERL_TEST_MD_CPAN_VERBOSE.


0.01   2009-12-12

- First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
